# NOTE: THIS IS NOT BEING SOURCED by hyprland
# It is only here as a guide if you want to do it manually
# The file you should edit is ~/.config/hypr/workspaces.conf
# Since that is the work space rules being sourced by hyprland
# use nwg-displays to handle your workspace rules.

# ---- split-monitor-workspaces plugin ----
# https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces
#
# Each monitor gets its own independent set of workspaces (1-N) instead of
# global workspace numbers.
#
# Config location: ~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/UserSettings.conf
# Keybinds:        ~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/UserKeybinds.conf
#
# Dispatchers (replace standard workspace commands):
#   split-workspace N              - switch to workspace N on current monitor
#   split-movetoworkspace N        - move window to workspace N (follow)
#   split-movetoworkspacesilent N  - move window silently

# You can set workspace rules to achieve workspace-specific behaviors. 
# For instance, you can define a workspace where all windows are drawn without borders or gaps.

# Assigning workspace to a certain monitor. Below are just examples
# workspace = 1, monitor:eDP-1
# workspace = 2, monitor:eDP-1
# workspace = 3, monitor:eDP-1
# workspace = 4, monitor:eDP-1
# workspace = 5, monitor:DP-2
# workspace = 6, monitor:DP-2
# workspace = 7, monitor:DP-2
# workspace = 8, monitor:DP-2


# example rules (from wiki)
# workspace = 3, rounding:false, decorate:false
# workspace = name:coding, rounding:false, decorate:false, gapsin:0, gapsout:0, border:false, decorate:false, monitor:DP-1
# workspace = 8,bordersize:8
# workspace = name:Hello, monitor:DP-1, default:true
# workspace = name:gaming, monitor:desc:Chimei Innolux Corporation 0x150C, default:true
# workspace = 5, on-created-empty:[float] firefox
# workspace = special:scratchpad, on-created-empty:foot
