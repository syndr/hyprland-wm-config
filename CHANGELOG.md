# Changelog — KoolDots

## Unreleased

## Added

- Screensaver lockscreen: `swaylock-plugin` with a live xscreensaver "hack"
  background replaces hyprlock when installed (hyprlock remains the automatic
  fallback on hosts without it)
  - `SUPER SHIFT L` rofi picker to choose the hack (`Alt+P` live preview,
    `. random` entry); choice persists to `~/.config/hypr/.swaylock_hack`
  - hypridle DPMS listeners now give the screensaver a 20-minute window after
    lock before screens power off (hyprlock keeps its quick-off behavior)
  - `IdleWatchdog.sh` and the installer's idle-policy rewrite are
    swaylock-aware
  - Recovery from a misbehaving locker: TTY → `killall swaylock-plugin` lands
    in hyprlock (fail-secure), see README
  - Hack previews float centered at half the monitor size (title-matched
    windowrule; the X class is per-hack so the title is the stable handle)
  - Express upgrades now migrate a restored stock `lock_cmd` in the user-owned
    `hypridle.conf` to the screensaver launcher, and land config files that are
    new in a release (e.g. the picker's rofi theme) without touching existing
    user files

## v2.3.25

## Fixed

- Pane selection bindings fail in lua configuration
- duplicate bindings for terminal
- Created wrapper script for `thunar`
  - Wasn't always starting in Debian lua config
- keybindings in scrolling layout
- `copy.sh` not copying all lua files
- `WallpaperEffects.sh` in lua config it changed theme not just wallpaper
- system keybinds in LUA config
- handling of SUPER-Q close active in LUA config
- keybinds handingling in LUA config
- wallpaper effects it would not restore original wallpaper
- wallpaper selector it was resetting waybar style sheet
- Layout code refactor:
  - Layouts are now per monitor/workspace
  - When you set a layout mode, i.e. scrolling
  - It will udpate the `~/.config/hypr/workspaces.conf` file
  - Therefore it will be persistent on next login
  - The current layout is shown in upper left corner
  - This fixes issue with setting `workspaces.conf` manually
    - When you selected a layout from menu the bindings didn't match
    - Also previously the layout was globally applied
      - Thanks to `@aki` for finding and reporting this issue
- WIP: Fixing icon spacing issues in Waybar
- Waybar would start then be restarted at login
  - Changed start order, `ThemeMode.sh` runs before waybar start
  - This restores users dark/light theme choice before waybar starts
- LUA: `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE` in LUA was hard coded to `kvantum`
- LUA: Fixed `LuaAutoReload.sh` wasn't activating changes on save
- LUA: `lua_user_overides.lua` wasn't loading `system_keybinds.lua`
- `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland` shows failed after CachyOS update
  - A regression bug in CachyOS is causing the issue
  - Screensharing doesn't work as a result
  - I created a script to create and override until they release the fix
    - In the `Hyprland-Dots` directory
      - Often located in `~/Arch-Hyprland=/Hyprland-Dots`
    - Run the script `config/hypr/scripts/Add-override-Hyprland-Portal.sh`
      - I will also be uploading the script to the Discord server
- NVIDIA Hybrid laptops have issues with cursors and GDM
  - Added more defensive code with fallbacks
- Dynamic wallpaper is now also per monitor
- Disabled LayerRule for swaync
  - Caused execessive blurring of background
- WindowRule for `qcalculate-gtk`
  - Had same rule as `gnome-calculator` needed own sizing
- Hybrid NVIDIA cursor handoff improvements
  - Enables Xcursor fallbacks and optional setcursor refresh on hybrid laptops

      hl.workspace_rule({ workspace = "1", monitor = "HDMI-A-1", layout = "master" })
      hl.workspace_rule({ workspace = "1", monitor = "HDMI-A-1", layout = "monocle" })
  ```
- Sample `hyprlang` (.conf) versions also
  ```ini
      workspace = 1, monitor:HDMI-A-1, layout:scrolling
      workspace = 1, monitor:HDMI-A-1, layout:dwindle
      workspace = 1, monitor:HDMI-A-1, layout:master

  - `config/hypr/lua/startup.lua`
  - added equivalent startup command for Lua startup flow

## v2.3.22 — fork additions

Tracks upstream's `v2.3.22` version marker; the entries below are fork-only
features layered on top of upstream and do not correspond to upstream releases.

- 2026-04-26
- Idle alert and post-lock watchdog
  - Pre-lock 30s warning fires `IdleAlert.sh warn` plus a notification
  - Post-lock `IdleWatchdog.sh` escalates squawks (gentle → nag → dumbass)
  - Battery-aware via `OnBattery.sh`: AC-attached idleness is silent and
    does not advance the escalation tier
  - Watchdog skips squawks while any monitor's `dpmsStatus` is `1`, so the
    flash routine no longer yanks dpms off mid-password-entry
  - Per-tier sound pools and watchdog cadence overridable in
    `~/.config/hypr/idle-alert.conf`
- Greenscreen waybar uber-narrow tier
  - New preset `[TOP] Greenscreen Uber-Narrow` for outputs below
    `WAYBAR_UBER_NARROW_THRESHOLD` (default 900px)
  - Auto-generator routes each output to wide / narrow / uber-narrow
  - Narrow preset: `fixed-center: true`, native `hyprland/workspaces#rw`,
    audio icon set, network with icons, battery moved into status drawer
  - Matching CSS adds backlight and network selectors for the narrow class
- Portrait laptop support
  - Ship `hyprlock-720p.conf` as a sibling to `-1080p` and `-2k`
  - `Wlogout.sh` detects portrait orientation and uses a 2x3 square-cell
    grid with margins computed for the portrait aspect
- Bind brightness keys in the laptop template
  - `xf86Mon/KbdBrightness` up/down → `Brightness.sh` / `BrightnessKbd.sh`
- Ship `base16-greenscreen` rofi theme in the repo
  - `config.rasi` previously referenced `/usr/share/rofi/themes/...` which
    nothing installed; theme is now under `config/rofi/themes/` with the
    `@theme` directive pointing at the user-config path
- Wlogout layout and styling refresh
  - Uppercase action labels, JetBrainsMono Nerd Font, smaller font/icons,
    tighter button radius and margins, hardened red for the danger button

## v2.3.19

- 2026-01-20
- Fixed CSS to format the `custom/nightlight` module
- Fixed padding on some CSS files

- 2026-01-19
- Removed "Set wallpaper SDDM prompt"
- When changing wallpaper there is no longer a prompt to set it on SDDM
- It's now a menu option under Quick Settings menu `SUPER SHIFT + E`
- Fixed `Glass` style sheets

- 2026-01-16
- Added `Rainbow Borders sub memu`
  - Code provided by [brunoorsolon](https://github.com/brunoorsolon)
  - There are now mulitple modes for the Rainbow Borders feature
  - `Disabled`, `Wallust Color`, `Rainbow`, `Gradient flow`
  - Thank you for the submission
- Disabled `RainbowBorders.sh` by default
- Use the quick setings menu `SUPERSHIFT + E` to enable, select mode

- 2026-01-15
- Created waybar configs for ML4W Glass style
- `TOP & Bottom Summit - glass`
- `Default Laptop - Glass`
- `Everforest - Glass`
- Fixed menu for express-update
- Fixed `Toggle Rainbow` checked for wrong file

- 2026-01-13
- Added `Toggle Rainbow borders` option to settings menu
- `SUPERSHIFT+E` search for `Rainbow`
- It will toggle the current state and run `Refresh.sh` to start or stop
  - Thanks to @Arkboi for suggesting it.
  - Later if there are more settings like this I will create a new menu

- 2026-01-11
  - Improved `ML4W Glass` theme
    - Now has proper 3d gradient look
    - Theme based nightlight color
  - `copy.sh` is now more modular
    - Helper scripts in `scripts` dir per function
    - Making `copy.sh` smaller (1200 lines to 800 so far)
    - Easier to maintain going forward

- 2026-01-09
  - Fixed: Keybind parser latency
    - Changed the parsing login to python instead of bash
    - Also fixed duplicates when you unmap, then remap keybinds
      - Ex. Change keybind for `file manger`
        - Both the old and new keybind were show in keybind menu
  - Added: `--express-update` to `copy.sh`
    - `./copy.sh --express-update`
    - This will bypass some of the questions
      - Updating SDDM wallpaper
      - Downloading wallpaper from repo
        - Mostly like that was done at install time or previous upgrade
      - Restoring User configs :
        - `Weather.sh` and `Weather.sh`
        - `Rofibeats.sh`
        - etc.
      - Automatically trims the backed up directories leaving just latest backup
      - This dramatically reduces the time/effort to update dotfiles
        - Most users don't restore these custom files on upgrades

- 2026-01-08
- Fixed: MPRIS artwork in Sway notification center only 10 pixels
  - Adjusted to 96 pixels
  - Thank you @godlyfas for fixing this
- Fixing scripts
  - `TouchPad.sh` never expands `$TOUCHPAD_ENABLED` (and doesn’t source the file that defines it)
  - `Volume.sh` has multiple microphone-control bugs (bad `pamixer` arguments, typoed function name, invalid notification payloads) that break mic toggling and volume feedback.
  - `DarkLight.sh` wipes the Qt theme paths each run because the `qt5ct/qt6ct` palette variables are commented out.
  - `KooLsDotsUpdate.sh` contains a malformed `notify-send` string that crashes the script when no local version is detected.
  - `Distro_update.sh` runs `sudo apt upgrade` outside the kitty window, so the Debian/Ubuntu flow never finishes inside the terminal.
  - `Hypridle.sh` now launches `hypridle` in the background (`& disown`) when enabling the daemon, preventing the toggle command from hanging Waybar.
  - `RofiSearch.sh` verifies that `jq` is available, captures the user’s query explicitly, URL-encodes it via `jq` `@uri`,
    - opens the configured search engine with the encoded query instead of dropping the term.
  - `Sounds.sh` now tries `pw-play`, then `paplay`, then `aplay`, emitting a clear error if none are installed, so the script no longer calls the non-existent pa-play.
  - `Tak0-Per-Window-Switch.sh` now records the listener PID in `~/.cache/kb_layout_per_window.listener.pid` and reuses it if still running, preventing multiple background listeners, and reports missing Hyprland sockets without exiting the main script.
  - `WaybarScripts.sh` adds a `launch_files()` helper that checks `$files` before execution; if unset, it shows a notification instead of running an empty command.
  - `sddm_wallpaper.sh` validates `~/.config/rofi/wallust/colors-rofi.rasi` before use, extracts colors via a helper, and aborts with a notification if any required colors are missing.
  - `WallustSwww.sh` now reads the focused monitor’s cache file (or parses swww query per-monitor) to pick the correct wallpaper path
    - Eliminating the previous “last line wins” bug on multi-monitor setups.
    - Wallpaper and global theme changes are now dramatically faster
  - `PortalHyprland.sh` suppresses harmless killall errors and launches only the first available portal binary in each category (hyprland + general)
    - Avoiding duplicate processes when both `/usr/lib` and `/usr/libexec` variants exist.
  - `KillActiveProcess.sh` checks that Hyprland returned a numeric PID before calling kill
    - Notifies the user when no active window is available instead of throwing kill usage errors.

- 2026-01-06
  - Added Global Theme Changer.
    - There are many themes to choose from
    - `SUPER + T`
  - Added "Glass Style" taken from `ML4W` dotfiles
    - Thank you [TheAhumMaitra](https://github.com/TheAhumMaitra)
  - Fixed more WindowRules
  - Fixed rofi themes to work with Theme changer
  - Added `ghostty` terminal config file integrated with Themes
    - `ghostty` is not installed by default
    - The `COPR` is already there for Fedora
      - `sudo dnf install ghostty`
  - The `COPR` repo for `wezterm` is also available
    - `sudo dnf install wezterm`
    - A config file is already available when you install it
    - Most other distros have these terminals in their repo

- 2026-01-04
- Fullscreen or maximized would exit using `ALT-TAB` (cycle next/bring-to-front)
  - User `GoodBorn` found this fix

  ```
  misc {
   on_focus_under_fullscreen = 1
   # 0 - Default, no change
   # 1 - New focused window takes over fullscreen (Windows-like Alt-Tab)
   # 2 - New focused window stays behind the fullscreen one
   }
  ```

  > Note: The above change only works on Hyprland v0.53+.
  > Users with lower will have to comment that line out.
  > `~/.config/hypr/UserSettings/SystemSettings.conf`
